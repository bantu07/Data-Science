# Prediction based on only Volume 
model.carV<-lm(MPG~VOL)
summary(model.carV) # Volume became significant

# Prediction based on only Weight
model.carW<-lm(MPG~WT)
summary(model.carW) # Weight became significant

# Prediction based on Volume and Weight
model.carVW<-lm(MPG~VOL+WT)
summary(model.carVW) # Both became Insignificant

# So there exists a collinearity problem b/n volume and weight

## Variance Inflation factor to check collinearity b/n variables 
vif(model.car)
## vif>10 then there exists collinearity among all the variables 

## Added Variable plot to check correlation b/n variables and o/p variable

## VIF and AV plot has given us an indication to delete "wt" variable
